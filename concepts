5 basic types of packages:
    meteor-base ...core components
    First-party
    Local packages ...specific to your app. Live in /packages dir
    Atmosphere ...custom, 3rd party packages available at online package repo (Atmosphere)
    NPM packages are Node.js packages. Can't be included in package Meteor package list. Can be used in a Meteor local or atmoshpere package




microscope <-meteor project root directory
├── client <----------------------stuff in here is only available to the client
│   ├── main.html <-- loaded last because main.* loaded last
│   └── main.js  <--loaded last
├── lib <------------------------stuff in here is available to client and server :Loaded FIRST
├── public <---------------------------client and server. Static assects (fonts, images, etc) go here
└── server <----------------------stuff in here is only available to te server
|__.meteor <--special hidden files for under-the-hood meteor stuff.

...everything else is loaded in alphabetical order by file name.

add a templates directory...
.
├── client
│   ├── stylesheets <-- css goes in here 
│   └── templates <---- templates go in here!
├── lib
├── public
└── server

NOTE: meteor will find all .js and .css files in the client folder. You do not need to wite inlude paths for these files! HURRAY!!!


3 Kinds of template things from Handlebars...

1.)Inclusions use the {{> templateName}} syntax, and simply tell Meteor to replace the inclusion with the template of the same name 
2,)Expressions such as {{title}} either call a property of the current object, or the return value of a template helper as defined in the current template's manager 
3.)block helpers are special tags that control the flow of the template, such as {{#each}}…{{/each}} or {{#if}}…{{/if}}
